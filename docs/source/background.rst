Background
==========
Jinki Jung and Hyeopwoo Lee, as a research team, had conducted several series of user experiments on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) based training (virtual training for short).
While repeating similar procedure of developing virtual training, they found out that the core value of the program is transferring the information that should be transferred to a trainee precisely
whereas the implementation of it from a training script is very tough and even tedious process with a high risk of restarting from scratch when it does not fit to the trainer's expectation.

What matter is the procedure
============================
Even though the visual effects are crucial part of building immersion of virtual training, the procedure within the trainee's experience from it is significantly important as it used as a tool.
Hyeopwoo Lee initially proposed the idea of Pairwise Authoring that organize the procedure with the pairing components of Action and Target, assuming for single user.
