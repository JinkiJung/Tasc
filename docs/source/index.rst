==============================
Tasc |version| documentation
==============================
**Tasc**, from TAsc SCript, is a procedure model for scenario description, information transfer, and performance evaluation.
The goal of this work is to radically reduce the time and cost of implementing a scenario to an executable program of VR/AR or simulation.
The scope of Tasc is not only for modeling of scenario, but also engine that consume and realize the script.
Tasc model will contribute more accurate communication of client and developer through syntax in implementation.

Primary usage of Tasc will be:
  * Simple creation of a scenario or a situation with sequential flow
  * Designing information transfer for user within context
  * Evaluating user performance on a per-step basis or whole
  * Plug-and-play scenario execution based on Tasc script and engine (e.g., Tasc-Unity)
  * Evaluation of scenario itself (quality of scenario in terms of information transfer)
