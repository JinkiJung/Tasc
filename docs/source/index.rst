Tasc |version| documentation
==============================
Tasc is a procedure model for scenario description, information transfer, and performance evaluation.
The goal of this work is to radically reduce the time and cost of implementing a scenario to an executable program of VR/AR or simulation.
For virtual training, this model will provide a consistent understanding in implementation between client and developer.

Primary usage of Tasc will be:
  * Simple creation of a scenario or a situation with sequential flow
  * Designing information transfer while a user carrying out the scenario
  * Evaluating performance of the user (or agent) on a per-step basis or whole
  * Plug-and-play implementation of the scenario based on Tasc script and Tasc engine (e.g., Tasc-Unity)
